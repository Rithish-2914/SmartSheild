# SafePath: AI-Powered Road Safety Features

SafePath is a comprehensive, real-time safety platform that transforms driving from reactive to proactive using AI and community intelligence.

## 1. Predictive Risk Scoring (AI-Driven)
*   **Dynamic Risk Engine:** Calculates a live "Risk Score" (0-100) based on current location, time of day, and weather conditions.
*   **Time-Based Intelligence:** Automatically adjusts risk levels during night hours (10 PM - 5 AM) when visibility is low.
*   **Weather Integration:** Real-time adaptation to hazardous weather like rain or fog, which increases the likelihood of accidents.

## 2. Real-Time Hazard Mapping & Reporting
*   **Interactive Safety Map:** Visualizes high-risk "Red Zones" based on historical accident data (e.g., Silk Board Junction, WEH Mumbai).
*   **Community Crowdsourcing:** Users can click anywhere on the map to report live hazards such as:
    *   Potholes
    *   Blind Spots
    *   Stray Animals
    *   Oil Spills
*   **Community Verification:** An upvote system ensures hazard data remains accurate and reliable.

## 3. Driver Behavior Monitoring & Gamification
*   **Event Logging:** Automatically detects and logs risky driving behaviors:
    *   Sudden Braking
    *   Speeding
    *   Swerving
*   **SafePath Score:** Drivers maintain a personal safety score that updates in real-time based on their driving habits.
*   **Achievement Badges:** Users earn status badges (e.g., "Safe Driver," "Caution," "Risky") to incentivize better road habits.

## 4. Emergency SOS & Medical Integration
*   **One-Touch SOS:** High-priority emergency trigger that alerts the system of an incident.
*   **Live Hospital Sync:** Instantly queries the nearest verified medical facilities (hospitals/clinics) within a 15km radius.
*   **Immediate Navigation:** Provides direct Google Maps navigation links to the closest emergency room for critical "Golden Hour" response.

## 5. SafePath Cyber-Vision (AR Overlay)
*   **High-Contrast Visualization:** A specialized augmented reality-style map theme designed for low-light or night-time driving.
*   **Enhanced Visibility:** Makes risk zones and community-reported hazards "glow," ensuring they are visible even in challenging conditions.

## 6. Real-Time Simulation Mode
*   **Demo Capability:** Allows users to simulate driving scenarios (e.g., "High-speed pursuit in rain") to see how the system reacts and logs data in real-time.
