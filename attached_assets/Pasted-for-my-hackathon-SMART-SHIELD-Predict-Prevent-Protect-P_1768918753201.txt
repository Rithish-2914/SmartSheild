SMART SHIELD – Predict • Prevent • Protect
🚨 PROBLEM (WHAT YOU ARE SOLVING)
ps: practical solutions focused on accident prevention, road safety awareness, and safer mobility practices.
Road accidents happen due to:

No real-time awareness of accident-prone zones

Unsafe driving behavior not corrected immediately

Delayed emergency response after accidents

Existing solutions address these problems individually, not together.

💡 SOLUTION (1-LINE)

SMART SHIELD is a unified AI-powered road safety platform that:

Predicts accident risk before accidents

Improves driver behavior during driving

Triggers fast emergency response after accidents

🧠 CORE FEATURES (BUILD ONLY THIS)
🔴 Feature 1: Accident Risk Prediction (MAIN FEATURE)

Input:

Historical accident data (CSV)

Time of day

Weather condition

Logic:

Simple rule-based or basic ML model

Output: Risk Score (0–100)

UI:

Map with color zones:

🔴 High risk

🟡 Medium

🟢 Safe

Alert popup:

“High accident-prone zone ahead. Reduce speed.”

🟡 Feature 2: Driver Behavior Safety Score

Simulated inputs:

Sudden braking

Over-speeding

Scoring:

Start at 100

Unsafe action → score deduction

UI:
Safety score meter
“Safe Driver” badge
🔵 Feature 3: Emergency Response (Demo Mode)
Accident trigger button
On trigger:
Show location on map
Show nearest hospital (dummy data)
Golden Hour countdown timer
