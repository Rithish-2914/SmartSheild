This guide details how to demonstrate the core features of the **Smart Shield** platform for the "Safer India" hackathon.

## 🚀 Presentation Flow

### 1. Introduction (The Problem)
*   **Context**: India faces a high rate of road mishaps due to poor infrastructure awareness and delayed emergency response.
*   **Solution**: Smart Shield - A unified AI-powered platform for **Safer India**.

### 2. Feature 1: Accident Risk Prediction (Safer Road Infrastructure)
*   **Goal**: Show how authorities and drivers can identify accident-prone areas.
*   **What to do**:
    *   **Map Interaction**: Point to the **Red/Yellow/Green circles** on the map.
    *   **Indian Context**: Highlight locations like **Silk Board Junction (Bengaluru)** or **Western Express Highway (Mumbai)**.
    *   **Simulation**: Use the **Time** and **Weather** inputs in the "Live Risk Analysis" card.
    *   **What to show**: Change weather to **"Rain"** or time to **"22:00"**. Observe the **Risk Score** increase and the **Risk Level** change to **HIGH**.
    *   **Impact**: Demonstrates real-time awareness and infrastructure auditing.
